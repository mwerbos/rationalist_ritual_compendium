title: ARC Rockville's Shabbat script
---
Material components:

* Two Shabbat candles and candleholder
* Table set with wine/juice glasses for all attendees
* Lyrics sheet with [Landsailor](https://secularsolstice.github.io/songs/Landsailor/gen/) for all attendees
* Phone basket

We usually have everyone arrive 1/2-1 hour before the ritual begins. When it's time, we gather everyone at the table and:

* Light candles. Say the candle blessing:

    > We light these candles to bring clarity and beauty to our gathering. May they remind us to stay present with each other as long as they are burning.

* Pass around the phone basket. It is optional but recommended for attendees to place their phone in the basket for the duration.
* Have everyone fill their wine/juice glasses.
* Sing Landsailor together.
* Raise our glasses and drink.
* Thank everyone who brought food this week.
* Announcements (upcoming events, cancellations, etc.).
* Joys and concerns: Give everyone at the table a chance to pipe up with any life events of the past week that they want to share.
* Ask if anyone has a discussion question (or: if the leader has one in mind, they share it).
* Eat! And discuss, as desired.
* After the meal, don't forget to ask attendees to help clean up before they leave.
