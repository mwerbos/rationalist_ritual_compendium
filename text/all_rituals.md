TODO: Add Shabbat, Shavuot, Summer Solstice, and ask Rivka if she has additional things to add.

# Spring
## Passover

The Secular Seder originated in 2014 and has undergone several rounds of revision, evolution, and forking since. Here are all haggadot (plural of "haggadah", the ritual book used for Passover) known to me at this time.

# Winter
## Winter Solstice

For resources on Winter Solstice (sometimes called Secular Solstice to distinguish it from pagan celebrations, though it is not purely secular humanist), please visit [Secular Solstice Resources](https://secularsolstice.github.io/).
