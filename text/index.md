title: The Aspiring Rationalist Ritual Compendium
---

This is a collection of ritual material -- songs, speeches, and more -- used by people in the rationality community (and adjacency). [Secular Solstice Resources](https://secularsolstice.github.io/) already exists and is the definitive archive for all Winter Solstice content; this compendium is for secular seders (rationalist Passover), Summer Solstice, and everything else.

## Want to add your ritual here? (Please)
This website is on GitHub Pages, which means if you know how to make a GitHub pull request, you can just send me one!

If you don't, or if you're just too lazy, you can instead **send me an email** (mwerbos at Google's email service) with whatever materials you have, and I'll put them in.  I'm interested in descriptions of events, speeches, ritual contents, songs, and anything else you have that could be described as "rationalist ritual." Even if your local group or family just has a way of celebrating something that's different, I want to document it here.

TODO: add technical documentation for how the site is put together, once this is more settled.
