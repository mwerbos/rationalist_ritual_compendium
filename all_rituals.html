<p>The Secular Seder originated in 2014 and has undergone several rounds of revision, evolution, and forking since. Here are all haggadot (plural of “haggadah”, the ritual book used for Passover) known to me at this time.</p>
<p>TODO: pull in all the PDFs and link them here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="">The Original Rationalist Seder</a> by by Zvi Mowshowitz (2014). Heavier on rationalist-ingroupy stuff. Lots of jokes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">2016 Sarah Constantin / Andrew Rettek edition</a> (link lost) - It says 2017 but it’s identical to the 2016 one; I presume this is because of version control issues.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">Maia Werbos / Roger Curley edition 2017</a>. Mostly the Sarah/Andrew 2016 one, with various small edits and several larger ones. Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing the “Where Did We Come From” section and replacing it with a from-scratch “In Every Generation” section</li>
<li>some disclaimers at the beginning for non-rationalist attendees</li>
<li>Special formatting to make it print nicely as a booklet</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="">Boston 2017 / New York 2016</a> (v2.1, as linked in the Rational Ritual FB group, used without modifications) Much more humorous, and includes some changes to the seder plate. Stories section is longer and encourages additional stories to be told. Includes the original story of Passover (as well as commentary on it).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">New York 2017</a> (v2.2, basically 2.1 plus two new stories)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">New York 2018</a> (“very minor set of edits on v2.2. Drops the cell phone and usb memory stick from the seder plate, the Story about Seders, and Who Knows One – plus various wording fixes.”)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">Maiger 2019</a> (mostly same as 2017, some small edits for factual changes; Oppression section replaced by a section from one of the NYC Haggadot)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">Socially Distanced Haggadah, 2020</a> (“possibly by Jim Babcock”)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">DC/MD 2023</a> – based on Maiger 2019 but with additions for the seder plate and a few other edits.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="">Ilzolende Haggadah 2024</a>. This one is much closer to a traditional religious Haggadah, with some rationalist elements incorporated. It includes the standard Hebrew blessings and the traditional Maggid stories of escape from slavery in Egypt. (Questions? Contact ilzo on Discord, moral-autism on Tumblr, or ilzolende at Google’s email service.)</p></li>

<h2 id="smallpox-eradication-day">Smallpox Eradication Day</h2>
<p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250510031251/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/3/23709475/smallpox-world-health-organization-disease-covid-vaccination-health">Vox article by Kelsey Piper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So while May 8 isn’t a conventional holiday, in my house we celebrate it as one — with piñatas shaped like the smallpox virus, presents for the kids, a cookout, and a big party. Our kids are pretty young, and as far as they’re concerned Smallpox Eradication Day is one of the big landmark holidays of the year alongside Halloween and Christmas. …</p>
<p>On December 9, 1979, the disease was confirmed to have been eradicated, with the World Health Assembly making the declaration official five months later. (We celebrate the May date rather than the December one just because December isn’t a good time for a new celebratory cookout holiday and May is.)</p>
