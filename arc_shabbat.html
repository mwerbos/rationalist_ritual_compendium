<p>Material components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two Shabbat candles and candleholder</li>
<li>Table set with wine/juice glasses for all attendees</li>
<li>Lyrics sheet with <a href="https://secularsolstice.github.io/songs/Landsailor/gen/">Landsailor</a> for all attendees</li>
<li>Phone basket</li>
</ul>
<p>We usually have everyone arrive 1/2-1 hour before the ritual begins. When it’s time, we gather everyone at the table and:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Light candles. Say the candle blessing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We light these candles to bring clarity and beauty to our gathering. May they remind us to stay present with each other as long as they are burning.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Pass around the phone basket. It is optional but recommended for attendees to place their phone in the basket for the duration.</p></li>
<li><p>Have everyone fill their wine/juice glasses.</p></li>
<li><p>Sing Landsailor together.</p></li>
<li><p>Raise our glasses and drink.</p></li>
<li><p>Thank everyone who brought food this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Announcements (upcoming events, cancellations, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Joys and concerns: Give everyone at the table a chance to pipe up with any life events of the past week that they want to share.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask if anyone has a discussion question (or: if the leader has one in mind, they share it).</p></li>
<li><p>Eat! And discuss, as desired.</p></li>
<li><p>After the meal, don’t forget to ask attendees to help clean up before they leave.</p></li>
</ul>
