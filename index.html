      <h1>The Aspiring Rationalist Ritual Compendium</h1>
    </header>
<p>This is a collection of ritual material – songs, speeches, and more – used by people in the rationality community (and adjacency). <a href="https://secularsolstice.github.io/">Secular Solstice Resources</a> already exists and is the definitive source for all Winter Solstice content; this compendium is for secular seders (rationalist Passover), Summer Solstice, and everything else.</p>

<p>This website is on GitHub Pages, which means if you know how to make a GitHub pull request, you can just send me one! If you don’t, or if you’re just too lazy, you can instead send me an email (mwerbos at Google’s email service) with whatever materials you have, and I’ll put them in.</p>
