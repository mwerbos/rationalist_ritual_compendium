<p>This is a collection of ritual material – songs, speeches, and more – used by people in the rationality community (and adjacency). <a href="https://secularsolstice.github.io/">Secular Solstice Resources</a> already exists and is the definitive archive for all Winter Solstice content; this compendium is for secular seders (rationalist Passover), Summer Solstice, and everything else.</p>
